Surface Inspection using Computer Vision
Overview
This project focuses on automated surface inspection using computer vision and deep learning. It utilizes YOLOv8 and OpenCV to analyze surfaces and classify them as smooth or rough based on predefined bounding box labels. The goal is to provide an efficient, scalable solution for quality control in manufacturing.

Features
✅ Surface analysis using YOLOv8
✅ Classification of smooth and rough surfaces
✅ Bounding box annotations for defect detection
✅ Optimized model inference for improved accuracy
✅ Tested on static images
